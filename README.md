Introducing the MAGIC Gamma Telescope Emission Classifier
=========================================================


Overview
--------

Welcome to the MAGIC Gamma Telescope Emission Classifier project! In this project, we delve into the fascinating world of celestial signals using machine learning techniques to classify emissions detected by the MAGIC Gamma Telescope. The MAGIC (Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov) Telescope is designed to observe very-high-energy gamma rays, enabling us to explore cosmic phenomena and astrophysical processes.

The primary goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately distinguish between gamma-ray and hadronic emissions based on the signals captured by the MAGIC Gamma Telescope. We have successfully completed this project and achieved an impressive accuracy score of 0.85 using a TensorFlow neural network.

Project Components
------------------

The project consists of the following key components:

1.  Dataset: We utilized the MAGIC Gamma Telescope Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset provides features extracted from the telescope's measurements, including attributes such as energy, intensity, and time information.

Approach and Results
--------------------

We approached the problem by first understanding the dataset and its features. We performed exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the characteristics of gamma-ray and hadronic emissions. Data preprocessing was crucial to prepare the dataset for training.

For model development, we used a neural network implemented using TensorFlow. This allowed us to capture complex relationships in the data. Through iterative experimentation and hyperparameter tuning, we achieved an accuracy score of 0.85 on the test dataset, effectively distinguishing between different types of emissions.
